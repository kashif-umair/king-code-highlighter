KING Code Highlighter
====================

KING Code Highlighter to highlight different languages' code in a beautiful and intelligent way.

How To Use:

1- Just open the html page in your favorite text editor on which you want to use KING Code Highlighter.
In your head tag include following two lines.

`````html
  <link href="https://raw.github.com/kashif-umair/king-code-highlighter/master/css/prettify.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
  <script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/kashif-umair/king-code-highlighter/master/js/prettify.js"></script>
`````

2- Add <code>onload="prettyPrint()"</code> to your document's body tag.

3- Put code snippets in 
`````html
<pre class="prettyprint">...</pre>
`````
or
`````html
<code class="prettyprint">...</code>
`````
and it will automatically be highlighted.

EXAMPLE:

This is original without any formatting
`````
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142" />
  
  </body>
</html>
`````

After adding the KING Code Highlighter to your code, your code will look like this.
`````html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
  
    <img src="w3schools.jpg" width="104" height="142" />
  
  </body>
</html>
`````
